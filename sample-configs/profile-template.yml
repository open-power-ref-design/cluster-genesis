        The BMC subnet is the subnet which contains the BMCs ports of the
        nodes to be installed. Note that if Power-Up is configured to use
        DHCP for allocating BMC addresses, the entire subnet is assumed to
        be available for use.

        The BMC VLAN is the VLAN number of the vlan in which the BMC ports
        reside. Power-Up can create a tagged VLAN interface on a physical
        Ethernet interface of this installer node. If using VLANs it is the
        user's responsibility to insure that a port virtual id (pvid) exists
        already on the switch ports to which the BMC ports are connected and
        that the switch port to which the installer node is connected is in
        trunk mode with the PXE VLAN allowed.
