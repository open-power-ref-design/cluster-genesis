# This script uses a remote proxy node to download RPM packages. It
# facilitates downloading of Red Hat packages for an architecture
# other than the machine you're running the script on. Repo access
# must already be enabled on the remote machine. This script
# does not set up repo access on the remote machine.
#
#  Usage: get-dependent-packages.sh [userid] [host]
#
# This scripts creates the ~/puptempdl directory on the remote node
# and installs the yum-utils utilities. Packages are downloaded
# to the ~/puptempdl directory and then scp copied to the ~/tempdl
# directory on this node. The ~/puptempdl directory and it's
# contents are removed from the remote node after copying.
